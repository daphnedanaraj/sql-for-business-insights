# SQL for Business Insights

## Overview

This project demonstrates SQL skills by analyzing a sales commission dataset. The dataset is generated using Python in a Jupyter notebook and uploaded to Google BigQuery for analysis. In this project, I focus on querying data related to sales performance and commission distribution across different salespeople. The key insights drawn from the analysis help in evaluating the performance of salespeople and making business recommendations.

## Project Structure

- **`mock_data.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook that generates the mock sales data using Python and saves it as CSV files for uploading to BigQuery.
- **`images/q1.png`**: Screenshot of the SQL query output displaying the total commission earned by each salesperson.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation of the project, including SQL queries, insights, and recommendations.

## Question 1: What is the total commission earned by each salesperson?

This query calculates the total commission earned by each salesperson:

```sql
SELECT 
    sp.salesperson_id,
    sp.first_name,
    sp.last_name,
    SUM(co.commission_amount) AS total_commission
FROM `regal-bonito-467416-p3.edtech.commissions` co
JOIN `regal-bonito-467416-p3.edtech.salespersons` sp ON co.salesperson_id = sp.salesperson_id
GROUP BY sp.salesperson_id, sp.first_name, sp.last_name
ORDER BY total_commission DESC;
```

## Query Output

Below is a screenshot showing the query output with the total commission earned by each salesperson:

## Insights

### Top Performers:
- **Mindy Sutton** earned the highest commission ($70,070), followed by **Steven Price** ($68,168) and **Jessica Stewart** ($66,468).
- The **lowest performer** in this query is **Colleen Bailey** with $61,731 in commissions.

### Commission Distribution:
- The total commissions for the top 5 salespeople have a relatively small range between them, suggesting a balanced performance across the team.

### Business Recommendations:
1. **Recognize Top Performers**: Reward Mindy Sutton and Steven Price for their exceptional performance.
2. **Support for Lower Performers**: Colleen Bailey could benefit from additional training or mentorship to help improve sales and commission.
3. **Incentive Programs**: Consider implementing an incentive program to encourage consistent performance across the team.

## Question 2: Which salesperson ranks highest in total revenue generated in each region?

This query ranks salespeople by their total revenue within each region:

```sql
SELECT 
    sp.salesperson_id,
    sp.first_name,
    sp.last_name,
    s.region,
    SUM(c.course_fee) AS total_revenue,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.region ORDER BY SUM(c.course_fee) DESC) AS revenue_rank
FROM `regal-bonito-467416-p3.edtech.enrollments_with_salesperson` e
JOIN `regal-bonito-467416-p3.edtech.salespersons` sp ON e.salesperson_id = sp.salesperson_id
JOIN `regal-bonito-467416-p3.edtech.courses` c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
JOIN `regal-bonito-467416-p3.edtech.students` s ON e.student_id = s.student_id
GROUP BY sp.salesperson_id, sp.first_name, sp.last_name, s.region
ORDER BY s.region, revenue_rank;
```

## Query Output

## Insights

### Highest Revenue Generators by Region:
- **AMER Region**: **Jessica Stewart** generated the highest revenue ($197,000), followed by **Jim Schmidt** ($185,300).
- **APAC Region**: **Jessica Stewart** and **Steven Price** both generated the highest revenue ($190,300), with a tie for the top rank.
- **EMEA Region**: **Mindy Sutton** generated the highest revenue ($211,200), followed by **Steven Price** ($205,200).

### Revenue Distribution:
- The **AMER region** shows a clear ranking from highest to lowest, with Jessica Stewart leading the pack.
- The **APAC region** shows a tie at the top, indicating strong performance from both Jessica Stewart and Steven Price.
- In the **EMEA region**, Mindy Sutton stands out as the highest revenue generator, but the competition remains close between the top performers.

### Business Recommendations:
1. **Reward Top Performers by Region**: Recognize **Jessica Stewart** (AMER and APAC) and **Mindy Sutton** (EMEA) for their outstanding revenue generation in their respective regions.
2. **Further Incentive for Tied Performers**: For the **APAC region**, where **Jessica Stewart** and **Steven Price** tied for the top spot, consider offering additional incentives to both to maintain this high performance.
3. **Targeted Regional Training**: Based on the distribution, consider offering region-specific training programs to maximize performance in areas with more balanced or lower revenue distributions.
